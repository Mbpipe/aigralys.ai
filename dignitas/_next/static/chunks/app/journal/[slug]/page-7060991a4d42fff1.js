It is the hands of men who understand patience.</p>\n      \n      <p>The best cigars begin in volcanic earth—places like Vuelta Abajo in Cuba, where minerals give the tobacco its soul. The leaves are harvested by hand. No machine can feel when the leaf is ready.</p>\n      \n      <p>Then comes aging. Seven years. Ten years. The tobacco sits in cedar chambers, temperature controlled, humidity precise. Like wine, it develops complexity. The harshness fades. What remains is smooth, deep, contemplative.</p>\n      \n      <p>When you light a cigar, you are not smoking. You are participating in a ritual that spans centuries.
